/**
 * A super markdown renderer function. Renders svelte and kit docs specific specific markdown code to html.
 *
 * - Syntax Highlighting -> shikiJS with `css-variables` theme.
 * - TS hover snippets -> shiki-twoslash. JS and TS code snippets(other than d.ts) are run through twoslash.
 * - JS -> TS conversion -> JS snippets starting with `/// file: some_file.js` are converted to TS if possible. Same for Svelte snippets starting with `<!--- file: some_file.svelte --->`. Notice there's an additional dash(-) to the opening and closing comment tag.
 * - Type links -> Type names are converted to links to the type's documentation page.
 * - Snippet caching -> To avoid slowing down initial page render time, code snippets are cached in the nearest `node_modules/.snippets` folder. This is done by hashing the code snippet with SHA256 algo and storing the final rendered output in a file named the hash.
 *
 * ## Special syntax
 *
 * ### file
 *
 * Provided as a comment at top of a code snippet. If inside a JS code snippet, expects a triple slash comment as the first line(/// file:)
 *
 * ````md
 *  ```js
 *  /// file: some_file.js
 *  const a = 1;
 *  ```
 * ````
 *
 * ---
 *
 * For svelte snippets, we use HTML comments, with an additional dash at the opening and end
 *
 * ````md
 * ```svelte
 * <!--- file: some_file.svelte --->
 * <script>
 * 	const a = 1;
 * </script>
 *
 * Hello {a}
 * ```
 * ````
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### link
 *
 * Provided at the top. Should be under `file:` if present.
 *
 * This doesn't allow the imported members from `svelte/*` or `@sveltejs/kit` to be linked, as in they are not wrapped with an `<a href="#type-onmount"></a>`.
 *
 * ````md
 * ```js
 * /// file: some_file.js
 * /// link: false
 * import { onMount } from 'svelte';
 *
 * onMount(() => {
 * 	console.log('mounted');
 * });
 * ```
 * ````
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### copy
 *
 * Explicitly specify whether the code snippet should have a copy button on it.
 * By default, snippets with a `file` flag will get a copy button.
 * Passing `copy: false` will take higher precedence
 *
 * ````md
 * ```js
 * /// file: some_file.js
 * /// copy: false
 * const a = 1;
 *
 * console.log(a);
 * ```
 * ````
 *
 * @param {string} filename
 * @param {string} body
 * @param {object} options
 * @param {TwoslashBanner} [options.twoslashBanner] - A function that returns a string to be prepended to the code snippet before running the code with twoslash. Helps in adding imports from svelte or sveltekit or whichever modules are being globally referenced in all or most code snippets.
